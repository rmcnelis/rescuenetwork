The loading dock door was opened and someone came to my car and told me that there was already someone there and that they had three of the bags in their car but I was welcome to take the other three bags. So I’m not sure what happened there. When I got to the next step on the app it took me to a map where the drop off would be. Luckily I knew the area in Lawrenceville where this place was located because the map had me going to the northside near Allegheny General Hospital.

However, there was a lot more food than we expected. We fit approximately 18 boxes in my SUV. Luckily another volunteer arrived and took another 10 boxes/ bags. There was still at least a dozen boxes renaining for pick up. Unfortunately, we arrived at the delivery location, which was residential, and there was not anywhere close to park. We had to carry the boxes from up the street (not a big deal, but not expected either) The other volunteers had arrived before us and one of them told us to put the boxes outside the door as none of the residents  were wearing masks. The woman at the apartment did not speak english and seemed irritated. After we had unloaded about 12 boxes she yelled at me to talk to someone on her phone. Again, no masks and she was a little too close for comfort. The executive director from the organization was on the phone and asked that we put the boxes directly outside her door instead of the 4 feet to the right where we were placing them. Again, the door was open and there were several people just inside without masks. This was my first rescue and I am not sure if any of this is normal, but it would have been good to know that we would need to check in with a drivers license at the gate to the community. I assumed this was being delivered to a business location. Also, just wanted you to know that the recipients were not compliant with Mask wearing which i think woukd make a lot of volunteers very uncomfortable. Overall, i was very happy to volunteer and it was very easy to do using the app. A little bit of extra info about the drop off location could have been helpful. Thanks for the good work that you continue to do. I will definitley rescue again.","county":"Allegheny","description":"Produce","rescue status":"Completed","rescue date":"2/12/2021","donor location":"North HIlls","url":"https://admin.foodrescuehero.org/donations/169743/rescues/221677","volunteer name":"Jordan Bartels"},"color":"rgb(100,193,162)","size":1911.0},{"source":"216","target":"274","id":"3778","attributes":{"nonprofit":"This Generation Connection","rescue id":"218388","donor":"TMD Holdings","food type":"Non-Perishable","county":"Allegheny","description":"Juice","rescue status":"Completed","rescue date":"1/26/2021","donor location":"West Mifflin","url":"https://admin.foodrescuehero.org/donations/167034/rescues/218388","volunteer name":"Alexis Nicole Cromer #truck"},"color":"rgb(101,193,163)","size":1600.0},{"source":"206","target":"174","id":"23228","attributes":{"nonprofit":"Webster Ave Christian and Missionary Alliance Church","rescue id":"252833","food type":"Other","county":"Allegheny","description":"mixed grocery","nonprofit location":"WACMA Cares","donor location":"CFAP Only","url":"https://admin.foodrescuehero.org/donations/204169/rescues/252833","donor":"World Vision","volunteer comment":"Tuffany thought rhe rescue was coming at 3:30.
